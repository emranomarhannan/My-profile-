        <h1>“who is refugee?”</h1>

        A morning my child returned home from playground crying…..<br>
        sobbingly he asked: “Tell me father, who is a refugee?”<br>
         “Is it a curse or a name?”<br>
        
        My heart got hurt and wanted to scream.<br>
         A pearl of tear came down of my eyes<br>
          and I slowly rubbed my eyes with back of my hands….<br>
           and sought a nice answer for that question….<br>
           I told my son….”See my dear son….<br>do you know what homeland is?” 
        He said,<br> “Yes….you once told me that homeland is the home of the ancestors……”<br>
        I kissed him on cheeks and sadly added,<br> 
        “ If in a dark night, a group of thieves,<br>
         bandits burn down you father’s house<br> and start firing your home<br>
          from every corner and you get out of the house<br> because of the horror made
           by those aggressors <br>and live on the stone carpets of the strangers,<br>
            you will become refugee my son, my beloved."<br>
         
        Fresh tears wetted my son’s eyes<br> and worries darkened his mind and then said, <br>
        “ I understood that refugee is a homeless man.” Since then,<br>
         I took the sentence of my son as a single-verse poem and whisperingly<br>
          I started repeating the poem,<br> “You are right my dear,<br> refugee is a homeless man,
          <br> refugee is a nestless bird.”
